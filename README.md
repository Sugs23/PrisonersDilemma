# **Prisoner's Dilemma**

Python Code to rum simulations of Prisoner's Dilemma for different payoffs and calculate expected payoffs<br/>

## **Running The Code** <br/>
Recommended number of simulations: ```5000-8000```<br/>
Approximate runtime for 5000 simulations: ```1.89 seconds```<br/>

## **Background** <br/>
Prisoner's Dilemma is a game theory problem where two individuals have to make independent choice however the payoff for every individual is dependent on their collective choices<br/>
Their are two options, ```snitch``` or ```stay loyal```
The expcted value of payoff is difficult to calcute however it converges according to ```Law of Large Numbers```

## **Code Description** <br/>
This code simulates the choices for both prisoners and outputs resultant expected payouts for the strategies <br/>
It plots the expected value after every simulation to visualize the convergence
